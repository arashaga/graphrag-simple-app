Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\nbut when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\nconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\n  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\nfalling down a very deep well.\n\n  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to\nwonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\nsee anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\nnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\nhere and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\nsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\nfell past it.\n\n  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\nshall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\nall think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\neven if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely\ntrue.)\n\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\nme see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\nyou see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\nlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\nor Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\nor Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to\nsay.)\n\n  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\nTHROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the\npeople that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\nhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\nPlease, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\nthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\nnever do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n\n  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\nyou might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\nBut do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\nrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\nway, `"

(when she thought\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\nbut when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\nconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\n  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\nfalling down a very deep well.\n\n  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to\nwonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\nsee anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\nnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\nhere and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\nsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\nfell past it.\n\n  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\nshall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\nall think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\neven if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely\ntrue.)\n\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\nme see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\nyou see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\nlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\nor Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\nor Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to\nsay.)\n\n  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\nTHROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the\npeople that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\nhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\nPlease, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\nthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\nnever do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n\n  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\nyou might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\nBut do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\nrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\nway, `"
