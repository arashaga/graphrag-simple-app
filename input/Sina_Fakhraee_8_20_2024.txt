Selected Microsoft Projects  successfully  completed for strategic custome rs   
 
• Global Conversational AI Chatbot:  
I led and owned the most expansive Azure OpenAI production deployment for one of Microsoft’s 
strategic customers, successfully rolling out a global conversational chatbot to over 100,000 end -
users. Built on Azure OpenAI and enhanced by Cognitive Search and other AI services like Form 
Recognizer, this project was a technically complex endeavor, especially given the challenges 
associated with ensuring data privacy and model integrity.  The successful delivery of this project 
led the customer to adopt the reference architecture and implementation developed during this 
engagement, paving the way for the deployment of several additional conversational chatbots 
following this blueprint.   
 
• Multi -Agent Solution for Supply Chain Hotline Issues :  
I successfully led the development of a multi -agent solution to address and summarize supply chain 
"Hotline" issues for a Microsoft strategic customer’s global purchase supply chain. This solution 
was integrated with the customer’s existing Insight Application, a critical tool used by their Supply 
Chain Command Center to monitor and track issues reported by plants or suppliers that could 
potentially impact vehicle production if unresolved.  The new system automatically summarized 
incoming issues and augmented these summaries with relevant data, including affected parts, 
contact information, inventory levels, and expected impact dates. This automation significantly 
reduced the manual steps previously required to gather and analyze this information . 
 
• Real -Time Speech -to-Text Chatbot for Motorsports Event Analysis :  
I led the design and development of a conversational AI chatbot for a Microsoft strategic 
customer’s Motorsports division. The project aimed to enable their race teams' analysts to query 
real-time speech -to-text transcriptions during NASCAR events. The solution was successfully 
deployed to production and significantly enhanced the team's ability to analyze and react to race 
data in real time.  
To develop this solution, I utilized the Retrieval -Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern and 
leveraged Azure Databricks for processing large volumes of real -time data streams at scale. Azure 
AI Search was implemented for fast write and read capabilities, while Azure OpenAI provided 
generative AI functionalities to support complex, context -aware queries.   
 
• Vehicle Mechatronic Embedded Controls (VMEC) Chatbot :  
I successfully led the development of a chatbot designed to assist in filtering and analyzing 
calibration test data files across multiple vehicles for a customer’s Vehicle Mechatronic Embedded 
Controls (VMEC) team. The chatbot leveraged AI to automate the process of identifying and 
investigating specific examples of undesirable behavior in vehicle signals, significantly 
streamlining the workflow for calibrators.  
 
• ML Solution for Distribution Operations - Wire Down Detection :  
I led the engagement for a Microsoft strategic customer, overseeing the conversion of their on -
premise rule -based system for wire down detection into a modern machine learning (ML) solution 
on Azure.  The Azure Machine Learning solution delivered a significant business impact, saving the 
customer approximately $3 million annually by reducing unnecessary utility crew dispatches to 
non-wire down events.  The new ML model improved predictability to 87%, a 40% increase over 
the legacy rule -based system.

during the racing events  
▪ Used micro services and docker/container technology to expose the model for real -
time consumption by the downstream systems  
 
 
• Containerization of cplex optimization engine for enterprise cloud -native systems : 
• Developed micro -service layer to expose cplex functionalities
